# Generated Image Licensing

## License for Images Generated by WikiMolGen

**Images generated using WikiMolGen are NOT covered by the MIT License of the software.**

### User's Choice of License

**The goal of WikiMolGen is to make molecular visualization accessible to everyone. Use the generated images freely in whatever way best serves your needs**

When you generate molecular structure images using WikiMolGen, **you** (the user) have complete freedom to choose the license for the generated images. The images are yours to license as you see fit. This project is a tool mostly based on existing libraries.

### Common Licensing Options for Generated Images

You may choose to license your generated images under any license, including but not limited to:

   - Various other CC combinations

3. **Your Own Custom License**
   - You may write your own terms
   - You control how others may use your images

### Attribution to WikiMolGen (Optional)

**Attribution to WikiMolGen is optional.** While I would appreciate recognition of the project and the tools undearneath, it is not required, especially for 2D renders.

### Recommended for Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons

For images intended for Wikipedia or Wikimedia Commons:

1. **License**: Creative Commons CC0 (Public Domain) for 2D images and CC BY-SA 4.0 for 3D renders
2. **Optional attribution**: "Generated using WikiMolGen (RDKit and PyMOL-based tool)"

### Chemical Data Sources

Please note:
- **PubChem data** is in the public domain (US government work)
- **SMILES strings** represent chemical structures and are not copyrightable
- **Molecular structures** themselves are facts of nature and not copyrightable
- **The visualization/rendering** is your creative work
